Student ID: 2385162
Partner: Will Curtiss (Stevens Class CPSC 350-01)

When program is ran, you have the options to enter student and faculty data
delete student and faculty data, display data, change a student's advisor given the student 
and the new faculty id, and remove an advisee from a faculty member given the ids.

I really struggled trying to understand how binary search trees worked
at the start of this project and how to implement the scape goat tree.
This project took a lot of time.

To build project on command line: g++ -o test.o *.cpp
To run program after built: ./test.o
